        <h2>PROMYC® AS AN INDUSTRIAL INGREDIENT </h2>
        <p class="vegan">Promyc® is a vegan mycoprotein ingredient produced through biotechnology with the fermentation
            process as
            a<br>
            core. Our production process allows us to be a lot more efficient than traditional farming in terms of time,
            cost and<br>feedstock, with much less environmental impact. It also enables the decentralization of food
            production, making it<br> possible to produce Promyc® wherever needed. </p>

            <p>Promyc® is in fact quite a boring ingredient – neutral colour, taste, and <br> smell. But boring doesn’t
                necessarily mean a bad thing. Besides being<br>neutral in colour, taste, and smell, Promyc is a
                sustainable
                mycoprotein <br>ingredient that can be used to produce vegan food products and that <br>brings a great
                source of
                fibre and protein, nutrition, and healthy <br> vitamins while offering a great texture.</p>
